## opam-rt

The goal of `opam-rt` is to test for regression in OPAM as most corner-cases issues as quite hard to test in the (limited) OPAM test-suite.

### Status

This is work-in-progress, mainly dedicated to test the new `opam
update` strategy (see https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/pull/719). As
it is still the early days, the API will evolve quite quickly, but any
help to write some regression tests will be greatly appreciated.
